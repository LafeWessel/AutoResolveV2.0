/*General Notes
*
* -In almost all constructors, the variables passed in have an 'I' following their name. This indicates that they are 'Input' variables.
*
* -Most, if not all, <<ostream operators for the enum classes use hard-coded output values.
*
Order of variables in Equipment file:
1. Type: A(Armor), W(Weapon), T(Trinket), B(Banner), F(Follower) (string/char)
2. Name (string)
3. Effect(s) (string)
4. Coin Value (int)
5. Index Value (int)
6. Autoresolve Bonus (int)
7. Range (int)

The 'Corpse Thief' Follower equipment has 1 as it's autoresolve bonus to help calculate bonuses when finding treasure at the end of battles.


Order of Variables in Units file:
1. Faction: 1,2,3, or 4, follows the enum class defined below (int)
2. Name (string)
3. Type: Melee(1), Cavalry(2) or Ranged(3) (int)
4. Autoresolve Bonus (int)
5. Soldiers in each unit(int)
All variables are comma-separated, so there must be no extraneous commas.
*
*
*Equipment and Units files must be put in the same directory as the .exe that is generated when the project is built.
*This seems to be a bit temperamental, so I have them copied into 5 separate areas of the program to ensure it works
